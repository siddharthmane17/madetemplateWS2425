## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
A Comparative Analysis of Solar Energy Infrastructure and Electric Vehicle Adoption Patterns

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do the spatial distribution of solar energy generation infrastructure and the adoption patterns of electric vehicles correlate in terms of environmental sustainability in California and Washington State?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to compare the distribution of solar energy infrastructure in California with the adoption rates of electric vehicles in Washington. By analyzing the Solar Footprints dataset and the registered Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in Washington, we will investigate patterns of renewable energy generation and consumption. The goal is to understand how solar energy generation influences electric vehicle adoption, drawing insights into how these technologies could be synchronized for better environmental impact. Through spatial and statistical analysis, this project will offer data-driven recommendations for improving sustainable energy systems in both regions.

### Datasource1: Solar Footprints in California
* Metadata Context:	https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/catalog.jsonld
* License: https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/
* Data URL: https://cecgis-caenergy.opendata.arcgis.com/api/download/v1/items/9398e39a0424434b9e95ccf8e8938807/csv?layers=0
* Data Type: CSV

### Datasouce Description
Solar Footprints in CaliforniaThis GIS dataset consists of polygons that represent the footprints of solar powered electric generation facilities and related infrastructure in California called Solar Footprints. The location of solar footprints was identified using other existing solar footprint datasets from various sources along with imagery interpretation analysis. CEC staff reviewed footprints identified with imagery and digitized polygons to match the visual extent of each facility.

### Datasource2: Electric Vehicle Population Data
* Metadata Context:	https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/catalog.jsonld

* Data URL: https://data.wa.gov/api/views/f6w7-q2d2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD
* Data Type: CSV

### Datasource Decription
This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).
