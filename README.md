# Title

A Comparative Analysis of Solar Energy Infrastructure and Electric Vehicle Adoption Patterns

# Description

The global shift toward sustainable energy solutions has placed solar energy and electric vehicles (EVs) to the forefront of modern energy regulations. In order to examine their interdependencies and offer useful information for energy planning in both urban and rural areas, this study looks into the adoption trends of solar energy installations and electric vehicle registrations. We find trends, correlations, and important factors influencing adoption in both urban and rural areas by examining two extensive datasets: data on solar energy installations and data on electric car registrations. The study finds that large-scale solar farms in rural areas and rooftop solar installations in urban areas have complementing connections with EV adoption. The recommendations for energy policies that close the gap between urban and rural areas and promote a cohesive, sustainable energy ecosystem are based on this investigation.
